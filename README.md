# Description
stock management web app is a versatile and user-friendly tool designed to efficiently handle stock data. It has been developed using a combination of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Next.js. Here's a detailed description of your stock management web app:
1. Purpose:
  - My web app serves as a central platform for managing stock data. It caters to businesses or individuals looking to keep track of inventory and make necessary updates in a seamless manner.
    
2. Key Features:
   - Insert Stock Data: Users can easily add new stock data to the system. This feature likely includes fields for item name, quantity, price, SKU (Stock Keeping Unit), and other relevant information.
   - Delete Stock: Users have the capability to remove items from their stock list. This is crucial for keeping inventory records up to date and removing items that are no longer in stock.
   - Update Stock: Users can update existing stock data. This can involve modifying quantities, prices, or other details. It ensures that the system accurately reflects the real-world state of inventory.
     
3. User Interface:
   - HTML & CSS: HTML and CSS have been used to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. This includes layout design, buttons, forms, and overall styling to enhance the user experience.
   - JavaScript: JavaScript is used to add interactivity to your web app. It enables functionalities like real-time validation, dynamic content updates, and handling user actions (e.g., button clicks).
     
4. Next.js:
   - The use of Next.js indicates that your web app is built on a React framework. Next.js provides server-side rendering (SSR), which can improve performance and SEO optimization for your web app. It also facilitates   routing, making navigation smooth and efficient.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
